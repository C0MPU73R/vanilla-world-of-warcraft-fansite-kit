 - World of Warcraft® Fan Site Kit Version 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------

The World of Warcraft Fan Site Kit is a package of materials 
designed to assist in the creation of your own WoW Fan Site. 
Specifically, the kit includes logos, hi-res artwork, screen-
shots, graphic PSD templates, a simple example of an HTML 
page, and a host of character cut-outs sorted by class. 


------------------------------------------------------------
 - GRAPHIC FILES
------------------------------------------------------------
Graphic files contained within this kit are of the 
following file types: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG, and .PSD. The GIF, 
JPEG, and PNG files should be viewable in most image viewers 
and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  They can be edited in most 
basic image editors.  PSD files are layered templates and 
require a copy of Adobe Photoshop® to view and edit.


------------------------------------------------------------
 - REQUIRED LEGAL DISCLAIMER
------------------------------------------------------------
Every Blizzard fan site is required to display the 
following text somewhere on each page:

	World of Warcraft® and Blizzard Entertainment® are 
	all trademarks or registered trademarks of Blizzard 
	Entertainment in the United States and/or other 
	countries. These terms and all related materials, 
	logos, and images are copyright © Blizzard 
	Entertainment. This site is in no way associated with

 - BLIZZARD FAN SITE PROGRAM
------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that creating a World of Warcraft fan site is a 
great way to show your enthusiasm about World of Warcraft and 
cultivate a new community around the game, but creating a fan 
site does not in itself constitute admittance into Blizzard’s 
Fan Site Program. If you are interested in joining the FSP 
and feel that the fan site you’ve created meets the standards 
established by the current FSP members, feel free to email us 
at fansites@blizzard.com (anytime after August 2004), and 
we’ll be happy to review your site and consider it for 
inclusion. In general, we require that Blizzard FSP sites 
update regularly and that they are designed to appeal to the 
game’s audience as a whole and not only to specific guilds or 
clans. For more infomration visit the Blizzard FSP page: 
http://www.battle.net/fsp.shtml Furthermore, they must not 
contain or link to cheats, hacks, or obscene/explicit 
material.

Thank you for your interest in creating a World of Warcraft 
fan site; we hope you’ll find this kit useful, and we look 
forward to seeing what you’ve created!

-Blizzard Entertainment
